# Mentorship Matching Platform - Documentation

## Development Approach

I built this platform using vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate core frontend skills without relying on frameworks. The application has three main sections:

1. **Authentication**: Handles user registration and login using localStorage for data persistence.
2. **Profile Management**: Allows users to create and edit their profiles with skills and interests.
3. **Discovery**: Enables users to find and connect with potential mentors/mentees.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **State Management Without Frameworks**:
   - Used localStorage to persist data between sessions
   - Implemented a simple pub-sub pattern for UI updates

2. **Tag Input System**:
   - Created a custom tags input with add/remove functionality
   - Used keyboard events for intuitive tag creation

3. **Connection Management**:
   - Implemented different states for connections (pending, accepted)
   - Handled different behaviors based on user roles

## Future Improvements

1. Add real backend API integration
2. Implement messaging between connected users
3. Add profile pictures and more detailed user information
4. Implement search and advanced filtering
